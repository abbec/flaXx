flaXx is a Monte Carlo Ray Tracer.

# Building
To build the project you need CMake.

Under Linux, you also need development packages for
SDL.

If you build on Windows under VisualC++ you need DirectX SDK installed.

If you build on Windows with gcc, you will need DirectX headers and libraries for MSYS.

# Project status
The project is far from finshed and will probably not get that much attention from me. If someone would like to help and make it an actual usable raytracer, feel free to contact me!
